# Introduction
As an input, a video of a system in which tofus are passing through a potential area (window) is provided. The objective is:
1. To count the number of tofus each time a bunch of tofus passes through the window.
2. To count the total number of tofus in the entire video.
3. Display the output in the video and create a CSV file that includes the count of tofu in a bunch from its first occurrence.
